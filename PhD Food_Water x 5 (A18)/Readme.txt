PhD Food_Water - 2.0
This mod increases food and water loss by 5 times the original amount. 

I created this mod because I found I wasn't using food or water as often as I thought I should. I had installed the great FarmLife Mod by stasis78 and started creating all kinds of great recipes but found I was rarely using them. I started paying attention to how often I was eating and drinking and decided to make it a bit more challenging. So with this mod you really have to EAT and DRINK and I mean a LOT. It makes farming much more important. 

Try it out and let me know what you think. Oh, and try not to starve. 

I would very much enjoy your feedback.
